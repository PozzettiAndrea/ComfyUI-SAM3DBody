# Test Assets

This directory contains test images for integration testing.

## Usage

Place test images (JPG or PNG) in this directory to use them for integration tests in `tests/test_inference.py`.

If no images are present, tests will use randomly generated images instead.

## Recommended Test Images

- Full body photos with clearly visible human subjects
- Images at least 512x512 pixels
- Clear lighting and minimal occlusion
- Diverse poses and backgrounds for comprehensive testing
